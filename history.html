        Back when I was pursuing Electrical Engineering at Carmel College, we were asked to come up with ideas for our final engineering project. I was honestly confused at first — but then, the idea of an <strong>automatic shoe cleaner</strong> sparked in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shared it with my professors, and to my surprise, they encouraged me to build a prototype and present it. At the time, I had no clue where to start, though I had fragments of ideas floating in my head. I spoke to one of my best friends about it, and he was incredibly supportive.
      </p>
      <p>
        What followed were days — and then months — of trial, error, late nights, and learning. Eventually, I managed to put together a working prototype. It wasn’t perfect, but it was real.
      </p>
      <p>
        I submitted the prototype as part of my final project, and to my amazement, it didn’t just work — it <strong>impressed</strong>. The professors were intrigued by the functionality and vision. With my friends by my side, we decided not to let this remain just a college project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took it further. We built a brand, a website, and most importantly, a purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started from a humble cardboard box ended up being featured in <strong>Time Magazine</strong> — and today, JAKS stands as a symbol of innovation, simplicity, and the future of daily living.
